# Textadventure
 A short Textadventure writen in Python. 
 A very short coding task got very long.
 Building a Textadventure only using if, elif and else. I hope I won't get lost. 
 Please do try it out and give me some advice what to improve.
 But first and foremost: Have fun trying it out. 
 I am still working on it. so please be patiend, I am still learning.
