# Textadventure
 A short Textadventure writen in Python. 
 A very short coding task got very long.
 Building a Textadventure only using if, elif and else. I hope I won't get lost. 
 Please do try it out and give me some advice what to improve.
 But first and foremost: Have fun trying it out. 
 There are two possibilitys to play. If you have a dice you can use "A walk in the wild".
 If you don't own one, you can use "A walk no dice"
 I am still working on it. So please be patiend, I am still learning.
